# odin-calculator

This is a project I made as part of following The Odin Project curriculum.
It is a calculator with a functioning UI, usable with both the mouse and the keyboard.

Features:
A flexable display which shows the current calculation and the previous calculation.
Ability to chain together calculations, remembering the results of the last one.
Useful mathemtical functions: Sin, Cos, Tan, ArcSin, Log, etc, as well as all the operations
(addition, multipilication, exponentiation)
Can interpet minus and plus signs as both operators and as part of the number itself.
Can parse expressions and determine if they're correct or not.


Things I learned:
-How to implement expression evaluation from scratch with polish notation.
-Practiced HTML, CSS and Javascript.
