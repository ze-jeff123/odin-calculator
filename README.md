# odin-calculator

This is a project I made as part of following The Odin Project curriculum.
It is a calculator with a functioning UI, usable with both the mouse and the keyboard.

Features:
A display which shows the current calculation and the previous few calculations.
Ability to chain together calculations, remembering the results of the last one.
Useful mathemtical functions: (Sin, Cos, Log) as well as all the operations
(addition, multipilication, exponentiation, etc.)
Can parse expressions and determine if they're correct or not.


Things I learned:
-How to implement expression evaluation from scratch with polish notation.
-Practiced HTML, CSS and Javascript.
